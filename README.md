### Introduction :coffee: :

Hi, I'm a Computer Science & Economics student at Rutgers, currently on my last year.

I love implementing responsiveness and clean design to personal projects such as mobile and web apps that live on the internet; 

My interests range from Software Engineering to Machine Learning, as well as Data Analytics.

I am open to collaborate with current CS students & software engineers alike.
